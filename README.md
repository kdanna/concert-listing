# concert-listing
2017 Q3 RP Dev Day Creation 

I am hate that finding concerts at my favorite local venues is a multi step process.   I have to go to each individual website and jot down the shows that I am interested in going to.  This program is supposed to do the hard work for me.  It will scrape the concert listings from favorite venues' websites and output the information to an excel spreadsheet for easy browsing.
